# BATTERY-SIMULATION-SOFTWARE
Java-based Battery Simulation Software with real-time CAN (PCAN) communication. Features include status/fault monitoring, real-time data display, graphical current analysis, control commands, and multiple battery simulation modes (CV, CC, CP, CC-CV).

A **Java-based desktop application** designed for simulating and monitoring battery systems using **CAN (Controller Area Network) communication**, specifically via the **PCAN interface**. This software is ideal for use in battery testing, system simulation, and educational environments.

- **Real-Time Parameters Display**
  Shows live data from the battery system:
  - Voltage (V)
  - Current (A)
  - Power (KW)
  - CC Volts Limit
  - Battery Voltage

- **Graphical Visualization**
  Real-time plot of current (A) vs. time (s) for easy battery behavior analysis.

- **Mode Selection**
  Supports multiple charge/discharge modes:
  - CV (Constant Voltage)
  - CC (Constant Current)
  - CP (Constant Power)
  - CC-CV (Combined Mode)

- **Limit Settings**
  Define thresholds for:
  - Voltage Limit (V)
  - Power Limit (kW)
  - Current Max (A)
